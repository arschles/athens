name: Proposal
about: Propose a large change to Athens (not a feature request)

---

## Describe the change

Proposals are different from [feature requests](https://github.com/gomods/athens/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) because they are larger in scope than a single new feature. Here are some examples:

- Something that requires you to add 2 or more features
- Something that will take you 2 or more PRs to do
- Adding lots of new documenation pages
- A big change to part of the Athens architecture (even if it's just one PR)

What are you asking to change?

## Use cases

Where did you get the idea? You might need it at your work, you might know someone else who needs it, or you might have been dreaming it up. Regardless, we'd like to hear about it!
