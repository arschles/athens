# Pull Request Reviews

Whether you're contributing or reviewing pull requests, this document can help you!

- If you're reviewing, it can help you understand what to do
- If you're submitting a pull request, it can help you understand what folks
are going to do, how to help them, and how to get your pull request
merged faster

## Steps

We follow a lightweight list of steps in order to review 
[pull requests in the Athens project](https://github.com/gomods/athens)
(if you're not familiar with pull requests, see 
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)).

Here they are:

- Pull requests should be reviewed by at least one 
[contributor](https://github.com/orgs/gomods/teams/contributors)
or [maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/gomods/teams/maintainers)
    - We set Github to prevent a merge without one of those reviews
- Pull requests have to pass continuous integration (CI) tests
